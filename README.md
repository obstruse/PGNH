# Travelling Salesman Problem

**noun**: *travelling salesman problem*

    a mathematical problem in which one tries to find the shortest route that passes 
    through each of a set of points once and only once.

    The problem can be solved by analyzing every round-trip route to determine the shortest one. 
    However, as the number of destinations increases, the corresponding number of roundtrips 
    surpasses the capabilities of even the fastest computers.

    With 10 destinations, there can be more than 300,000 roundtrip permutations and combinations. 
    With 15 destinations, the number of possible routes could exceed 87 billion.
