polargraph_server_polarshield_esp32
===================================

Polargraph Server for NodeMCU-32S, which is based on the Espressif ESP32 chip, combined with an SPI-based 240x320 TFT touchscreen, an SD card reader and two A4988 stepper drivers.

These parts are integrated onto a board (Polarshield v3).

The display and touch routines are courtesy of Bodmers excellent TFT_eSPI library, which rolls up and optimises some of the Adafruit GFX libraries.

The ESP32 currently has sufficient pins for two full sets of:

* stepper motor (step & direction)
* position encoder (quadrature, A & B channels) 
* endstop switches

A full guide on how to wire this up and build the machine will be forthcoming over the summer.


The button and menu drawing routines are spread out over a couple of files:

* buttons.ino - initialise and define the button data
* buttons_actions.ino - the actions that get called when a button is activated
* lcd.ino - touch input handling
* lcd_draw.ino - for drawing to the lcd, layout



The program has a core part that consists of the following files that are common to all Polargraph Server versions:

- comms.ino
- configuration.ino
- eeprom.ino
- exec.ino
- penlift.ino
- pixel.ino
- util.ino

and 
- polargraph_server_polarshield_esp32.ino

which is named for the project and has a whole load global variables in it, as Arduino projects are wont to have.

The file called impl_ps contains implementations of a few functions, and also
contains the extended impl_executeCommand(...) which is the jumping-off point for those 
extended functions.
